# Cascaded-Pooling-in-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

#### Implementation of two variations of Cascaded Pooling Techniques on images that could be used in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to increase the training and testing accuracy of various image datasets. The two techniques in Cascaded Pooling are as follows:

1. Max-Max Pooling that replaces all the Max Pooling layers in a conventional CNN
2. Max-Average Pooling that replaces all the Average Pooling layers in a conventional CNN
